The primary objective of this project is to provide businesses within the sports industry with the actionable insights, enabling them to customize their strategies for diverse locations.In this project , I leveraged SQL for data querying, Excel for data cleaning, and Tableau for advanced data visualization.The ultimate aim is to elevate overall performance and sustain a competitive edge in a dynamic market environment.


I have deep delved into the data to answer the following business questions:
1.	Which states or regions generate the highest and lowest profits?
2.	Which products or product categories contribute the most to our profit?
3.	How many customers have given a rating/review?
4.	Can you pinpoint any specific months with outstanding sales performance?
5.	What percentage of customers leave reviews for their purchased sports products?
6.	Are there any correlations between profit and revenue based on ratings?

   
Key Insights from the Analysis:


California emerged as the highest profit-generating state with $34,554, while Maine had the lowest profit at $17.

Hockey stands out with the highest profit margin of 58%, suggesting it may be a particularly lucrative product category.

A total of 1,193 customers provided ratings or reviews, indicating customer engagement.

June was the highest revenue-generating month, with $56,407 in revenue and $42,802 in profit.
